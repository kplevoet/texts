TO ----

     I HEED not that my earthly lot
         Hath little of Earth in it--
     That years of love have been forgot
     In the hatred of a minute:--
     I mourn not that the desolate
         Are happier, sweet, than I,
     But that you sorrow for my fate
     Who am a passer-by.
