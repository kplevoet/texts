PREFACE
THESE
trifles
are
collected
and
republished
chiefly
with
a
view
to
their
redemption
from
the
many
improvements
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
while
going
at
random
the
rounds
of
the
press
I
am
naturally
anxious
that
what
I
have
written
should
circulate
as
I
wrote
it
if
it
circulate
at
all
In
defence
of
my
own
taste
nevertheless
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
say
that
I
think
nothing
in
this
volume
of
much
value
to
the
public
or
very
creditable
to
myself
Events
not
to
be
controlled
have
prevented
me
from
making
at
any
time
any
serious
effort
in
what
under
happier
circumstances
would
have
been
the
field
of
my
choice
With
me
poetry
has
been
not
a
purpose
but
a
passion
and
the
passions
should
be
held
in
reverence
they
must
not
they
can
not
at
will
be
excited
with
an
eye
to
the
paltry
compensations
or
the
more
paltry
commendations
of
man-kind
