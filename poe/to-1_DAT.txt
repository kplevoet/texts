The
bowers
whereat
in
dreams
I
see
The
wantonest
singing
birds
Are
lips
and
all
thy
melody
Of
lip-begotten
words
2
Thine
eyes
in
Heaven
of
heart
enshrin'd
Then
desolately
fall
O
God
on
my
funereal
mind
Like
starlight
on
a
pall
3
Thy
heart
thy
heart
I
wake
and
sigh
And
sleep
to
dream
till
day
Of
truth
that
gold
can
never
buy
Of
the
trifles
that
it
may
